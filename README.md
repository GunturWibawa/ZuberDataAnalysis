Data Analysis in Zuber RideSharing Company

The project assigned to me during the sixth sprint involves Collecting and Storing Data (SQL).

Throughout this sprint, I dived into the complexity of structured databases and learned the methodologies of retrieving data through SQL.

# **Project Insight**

As an analyst at Zuber, a recently inaugurated ride-sharing company in Chicago, I was assigned with discerning patterns within the accessible data. My responsibilities included determining passenger preferences and analyzing the effects of meteorological variations on travel patterns.

Upon observation and through visual representation, I arrived at the following conclusions:

1. The top five destinations frequented by taxi passengers are: Loop, River North, Streeterville, West Loop, and O'Hare.
2. The five enterprises with the most considerable number of trips are: Flash Cab, Taxi Affiliation Services, Medallion Leasing, Yellow Cab, and Taxi Affiliation Service Yellow.
3. There is a discrepancy in the average trip duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport on rainy Saturdays compared to other days.

Based on this analysis, the marketing team may consider the following strategies:

1. To augment customer satisfaction, prioritize in providing rides to the destinations that has the most visited by taxi passengers.
2. Consider by introducing the surge pricing during rainy days and Saturdays to accommodate the extended trip duration and incentivize drivers to maintain their service during such weather conditions.
3. Involve weather data to anticipate potential shifts in demand, enabling adjustments to driver availability as needed.
